# StoryBooks

### Reason behind the build
I wanted to create a more fleshed out version of a prior project I build where I made a blog with Vue and Node. For this build I focussed on Node + HandleBars while making use of Passport.js for the first time using the Google Strategy.

### Features
* CRUD Operations for Stories/Posts
* OAUth2.0 Login via Google+ 
* Saves Sessions, Users, and Stories in mongoDB using the Mongoose ODM
